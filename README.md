Overview

This repository contains my Cybersecurity Threat Report (Awareness & Research Project) completed as part of the Maincrafts Technology Internship Program.
The report provides a detailed analysis of modern cyber threats, recent high-impact attacks, and preventive security measures essential for individuals and organizations.


Key Topics Covered

The report covers in-depth research and case studies related to:

1. AI-Powered Phishing Attacks

Deepfake-driven impersonation

Spear phishing using AI-generated content

High-value fraud cases (BEC attacks)

Real-case: Arup Engineering Deepfake Scam (2024)

2. Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)

Subscription-based ransomware model

Double extortion techniques

Real-case: Change Healthcare Attack (BlackCat/ALPHV)

 3. Cloud Security Misconfigurations

Exposed S3 buckets

Weak IAM roles

Lack of MFA in cloud accounts

Real-case: Snowflake Customer Data Breach (2024)

 4. IoT Vulnerabilities

Weak security in smart devices

Hospital IoT ransomware attacks (2024)

Impact on patient safety and critical systems

 5. Zero-Day Exploits

Attacks before patches are available

Targeting VPNs and critical appliances

Real-case: Ivanti Connect Secure Zero-Day Exploit

Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated with AI, automation, and cloud adoption.
Global cybercrime damages expected: $10.5 trillion by 2025.

Importance of Zero Trust

A strong Zero Trust Architecture is critical to limit lateral movement and protect networks.
 
Proactive Security Measures

Security must be continuous—not reactive.
Organizations need:

MFA everywhere

Strong patch management

Network segmentation

Threat hunting

AI-driven detection tools

Future Threats
